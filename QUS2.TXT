Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript:-

     1. Object is building blocks for modern Javascript

     2. It is the collection of related data in the form of "key value"

     3. The key values are properties and methods of the object 

     4. For example, if cup is taken as an object then its properties is color, design, weight, a material  is made up of etc.

     5. objects are also called associative arrays because each property is associated with string value.  

     6. Properties values can be set by using a bracket notation.

     7. Creating the object javascript throug two methods. First is by object liberal and second is by creating Instance of object directly 

     8. Property and value of a object is seperated by colon (:). This is object literal method. Example:- frame: "YYY"

     9. New keyword is used to create object is instance of object directly. Example: Var emp = new object();
